\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

%TODO
%To write a demonstration dissertation\footnote{A normal footnote without the
%complication of being in a table.} using \LaTeX\ to save
%student's time when writing their own dissertations. The dissertation
%should illustrate how to use the more common \LaTeX\ constructs. It
%should include pictures and diagrams to show how these can be
%incorporated into the dissertation.  It should contain the entire
%\LaTeX\ source of the dissertation and the makefile.  It should
%explain how to construct an MSDOS disk of the dissertation in
%Postscript format that can be used by the book shop for printing, and,
%finally, it should have the prescribed layout and format of a diploma
%dissertation.


\section*{Work Completed}

%TODO
%All that has been completed appears in this dissertation.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

%TODO
%Learning how to incorporate encapulated postscript into a \LaTeX\
%document on both Ubuntu Linux and OS X.

\section*{Declaration}

I, Cheng Sun of Churchill College, being a candidate for Part II of the Computer
Science Tripos, hereby declare
that this dissertation and the work described in it are my own work,
unaided except as may be specified below, and that the dissertation
does not contain material that has already been used to any substantial
extent for a comparable purpose.

\section{Summary and structure of code}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item the driver
  \item the compilation module
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item AST
      \item translate
      \item fixup
      \item emitcode
    \end{enumerate}
  \item the runtime
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item OCaml standard library
      \item C runtime library
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Closures}

\subsection{Runtime support}

This consists of a function \lstinline{ocaml_liballocs_close(fun, n_args, env)}
which dynamically creates a 3-instruction stub in an executable buffer,
returning what looks like a closed function pointer f. Calling
\lstinline{f(1, 2, 3)}
(with the standard C calling convention) transparently causes a call to
\lstinline{fun(1, 2, 3, env)}.
Note that this won't work on anything but 64-bit Linux.

Note that this code must be written to a memory page which has both write and execute permissions. (This has security implications which mean that additional precautionary steps must be taken if this technique is to be used in production code.)

This area of memory is bump allocated. Note that a garbage collector would need to know about this.

\subsubsection{Closing functions that take $\le 5$ arguments}

This is the stub (when \lstinline{n_args} $\le 5$):

\begin{lstlisting}
mov REG_ENV, <env>
mov r10, <fun>
jmp r10
\end{lstlisting}

This works by writing the two 8-byte addresses directly into the machine code, and using immediate \lstinline{mov} instructions to load them into the required registers. Then the function is tail-called into.

This is what the stack transformation looks like: % TODO

\begin{tabular}{ c | c }
  \lstinline!n_args! & \lstinline!REG_ENV! \\
  \hline
  0 & \lstinline!rdi! \\
  1 & \lstinline!rsi! \\
  2 & \lstinline!rdx! \\
  3 & \lstinline!rcx! \\
  4 & \lstinline!r8! \\
  5 & \lstinline!r9! \\
  $> 5$ & passed on stack instead (see below) \\
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Closing functions that take $> 5$ arguments}

When \lstinline{n_args} $> 5$, env needs to get passed in on the stack instead.
This is a little awkward because:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item our stub needs to clean up after itself -- it can no longer just tail-call into fun. This means that we need to return back into our closure, but the original return address needs to be preserved somehow;
  \item we need to somehow tuck \lstinline{env} in under the return address stack slot, which would require an annoying amount of stack twiddling.
\end{enumerate}

Luckily, I came up with a neat trick which addresses both issues and remains performant. We can get away with just pushing \lstinline{env} on top (forming the (\lstinline{n_args}${}+2$)th argument), and pretending the return address is actually an argument (\lstinline{n_args}${}+1$)!

\begin{lstlisting}
mov r11, env
push r11
mov r10, fun
call r10
pop rcx
ret
\end{lstlisting}

This is what the stack transformation looks like: % TODO

This works because our compiler has control over the function signature of
\lstinline{f}
-- so in this case it'll just insert an additional \lstinline{void *ignored} argument before \lstinline{env}.

Note also the deliberate choice of \lstinline{pop rcx} to remove the \lstinline{env} address from the stack, instead of the more symmetric \lstinline{pop r11} or more direct \lstinline{add rsp, 8}. This is a size optimisation -- the chosen instruction encodes in just one byte whereas the others require two or more bytes.

\section{NaN boxing}

In order to support polymorphic comparisons, we need to use a technique to be able to distinguish pointers from immediate ints and doubles.
