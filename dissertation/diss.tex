\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

%TODO
%To write a demonstration dissertation\footnote{A normal footnote without the
%complication of being in a table.} using \LaTeX\ to save
%student's time when writing their own dissertations. The dissertation
%should illustrate how to use the more common \LaTeX\ constructs. It
%should include pictures and diagrams to show how these can be
%incorporated into the dissertation.  It should contain the entire
%\LaTeX\ source of the dissertation and the makefile.  It should
%explain how to construct an MSDOS disk of the dissertation in
%Postscript format that can be used by the book shop for printing, and,
%finally, it should have the prescribed layout and format of a diploma
%dissertation.


\section*{Work Completed}

%TODO
%All that has been completed appears in this dissertation.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

%TODO
%Learning how to incorporate encapulated postscript into a \LaTeX\
%document on both Ubuntu Linux and OS X.

\section*{Declaration}

I, Cheng Sun of Churchill College, being a candidate for Part II of the Computer
Science Tripos, hereby declare
that this dissertation and the work described in it are my own work,
unaided except as may be specified below, and that the dissertation
does not contain material that has already been used to any substantial
extent for a comparable purpose.
